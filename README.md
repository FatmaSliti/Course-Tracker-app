# Course Tracker App [Course Tracker App](https://course-tracker-hosting.web.app/)

Welcome to the Course Tracker App! Please note that this is just a preview version of the application, and it's currently in its early stages of development.

## Overview

The Course Tracker App is designed to help you keep track of your academic courses. You can use it to:

- Add and manage your courses.
- Track important information about each course, such as course name, instructor, schedule, and more.
- Monitor your progress, assignments, and deadlines.
- Stay organized and optimize your study routine.

## Learning Resources

The Course Tracker App is more than just a course management tool; it's designed to be a helpful guide for new developers based on the experiences and insights gained from completing various courses. Here's what you can expect:

- **Educational Insights**: Discover tips, tricks, and advice on how to excel in online courses and self-guided learning. Learn from the experiences of fellow developers.

- **Course Recommendations**: Find recommendations for courses that can boost your skills and knowledge in different areas of development.

- **Learning Pathways**: Explore suggested learning pathways and roadmaps tailored to your interests and career goals.

- **Community Interaction**: Connect with a community of learners who share their learning journeys and collaborate on educational projects.

We believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and this app aims to make that journey more manageable and enjoyable for new developers. Explore, learn, and grow with the Course Tracker App!

**Please Note**: The link above represents the early version of the app's user interface and functionality. I am actively working on improving and expanding the features.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
